## Project Overview 🔍

The mental health of medical students is a critical concern, with factors such as burnout, empathy, and job stress playing a significant role. This study analyzes a dataset consisting of demographic and internal wellbeing measures for medical students in Switzerland. Specifically, we focus on the relationship between employment status and stress levels, measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scale.

We conducted a t-test to compare the stress levels of students with jobs to those without, ensuring that normality and equal variance assumptions were met. The results reveal a statistically significant difference, showing that students with jobs experience lower stress levels compared to those without. These findings suggest that employment may offer a protective effect against stress, providing valuable insights for future mental health policies in medical education.

## Methods and Tools Used ⚙️

Throughout the project, we employed the following methods and tools:

- **Statistical Tests**: 📊
  - T-tests, normality tests, Shapiro-Wilk, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.
  
- **Hypothesis Testing**: 👨🏻‍🔬
  - Testing relationships between variables such as employment status and stress levels.
  
- **Correlation Analysis**: 📈
  - Investigated relationships between various features in the dataset.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**: 👩🏻‍💻
  - Implemented machine learning algorithms such as 'XGBoost', 'Gradient Boosting', and 'K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)'.

- **SHAP Analysis**: 📝
  - Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain feature importance.
